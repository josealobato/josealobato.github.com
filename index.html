        <h3>So... who am I?</h3>

<p>Ten years working as an automotive real time systems software developer with some of the best companies in the world (Volvo, Audi, BMW, Aston Martin,...) taught me the importance of a good software process. My love of OSX made me change my life to go solo on an adventure that resulted in the quite successful application, Watts, in the App Store. Missing the collaboration of others, I created 85% Cocoa, a popular Podcast, at the same time I began my regular pieces for the MacWorld Espa√±a magazine every month.
In addition to the creation of software solutions, I loves working in a team, adjusting and fine tuning it to create a happy group of developers capable of producing amazing products, that take that extra step beyond usability and user experience.</p>

<p>My two kids are my passion aside from software design and development, but I also love running and playing the guitar.</p>
